# Smart-green-house

Random IoT project previously done in school days.
Used PHP for site development, and a free online sql db to get and store sensor data.
Quit fun while handing all the data pipelines.
Hard to perform a action after receiving a critical data from sensor, then control back the IoT device to switch on or off some buttons.
